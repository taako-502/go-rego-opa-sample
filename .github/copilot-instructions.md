This is a Go demo project using Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego for authorization based on user attributes.
- Policy files are located in the `policy/` directory.
- `main.go` contains sample code to evaluate the `data.demo.allow` rule.

Please assist with:  
- Enhancing policies based on new attributes.  
- Improving sample code for dynamic input and CLI flags.  
- Any best practices for structuring OPA integration in Go.
